1.2 Business problem:

A major cause of high housing costs in the Silicon Valley is expansive job growth without adequate housing production. In 2018, close to 36,000 new jobs were created in the area (34% of which were tech jobs); only 8,400 new residential units were issued permits. Imbalanced demand and supply relationship in the housing market suggested potential good investment return from new house construction or remodeling of existed houses. However, as construction permit approval normally takes couple of years. While with background of COVID-19 and emerging working from home, there is uncertainty that whether the economy will continue its trajectory and the eovluation of house supply-demand relationship.

Local house prices have several determining factors: 1. Whether the neighborhoods have good school resources for the kids. 2. Whether the location is convenient for life and work commute. To assess which factor is the dominating factor, and whether this factor can withstand economic cycles, we will use Foursquare exploration and search functions to compare nearby schools, restaurants and high tech companies. In addtion, as employees from giant tech companies tend to live in the same city of their office buildings, there is close relation between house price and the performance of those companies.  For example, there could be correlation between Apple company performance and Cupertino house price, and Google performance and Mountain view house price. We will analyze several high tech companie's performace for the following years based on linear regression, and finally propose which city to invest in real eastate.
